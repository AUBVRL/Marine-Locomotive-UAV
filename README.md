# Marine-Locomotive-UAV
A MATLAB/Simulink implementation of a robotic system consisting of a quadrotor UAV that pulls a floating buoy across water. Velocity manipulation of the buoy is allowed through a tether that links the UAV to the buoy.


# Prerequisites
MATLAB/Simulink software v2018a or higher.

# Description
1. Use 'Marine_LocoMotive_UAV_est_git_parameters.m' to load the small system including a mini-multirotor and a small sized buoy. <br />
2. Use 'Marine_LocoMotive_UAV_medium_est_git_parameters.m' to load the medium system including a medium-size multirotor and a medium-sized buoy. <br />
